# REU Projects

While I'm open to discussing options for projects, these are the project I'm planning to offer at this point. I've posted some initial resources here and will try to get a Wiki set up soon to make it easier to continue posting information.

* Project 1: Is JavaScript still Eval?

* Project 2: Evolution of Open-Source Activity in the Research Triangle Park

* Project 3: Feature Usage in PHP

* Project 4: Feature Evolution in PHP
